# How-Burger-King-used-data-science-to-poach-McDonald-s-clients-in-Philadelphia-
As part of the article, we explore how Burger King uses data science and strategic billboard placement to attract McDonald's customer base. 

# Data Sources
The datasets used in this article have been imported from:
[OpendataPhilly ]
[Opendata]
[Google Maps] 

Google Maps APIs (Application Programming Interface) has been used to provide traffic data. The dataset is an open data set and is available to the data science community.  

# Data Analysis
The data has been analyzed using Python and visualized with Power BI. Here are the analysis steps: 
1. First get Philadelphia billboards data 
2. Next, you get McDonald’s data: Getting McDonald’s’ data is a bit challenging. But we can take help from Google Maps for the same. Once you have all the requirements satisfied you can use the url to fetch the data. Make sure you correctly enter the API key.
3. Next, plot McDonald’s data using the Google Maps API.
4. Calculate the distance between McDonald's and using the Philadelphia billboards data. The advantage of doing this is, Burger King can save the cost of ineffective advertisement and can invest only where there are McDonald’s outlets, effectively reaching out to potential customers. 
5. First we see the umber of billboards around a 100 Meters, 250m, 1/2 a km, and one km. 

# Summary
After analyzing all the data, we draw the following conclusions:

Burger King can advertise close to McDonald’s by leveraging the power of Data Science. By doing so, Burger King can gain very loyal customers and achieve a return on investment. 
If we look at the data, it seems like billboards with a 100m radius are the best choice since the target focuses on McDonald’s customers. 
McDonald’s is the direct competitor of Burger King; hence if Burger King utilizes the billboards within 100m, it will help them gain loyal customers. 
Besides the 100m setup, 250m is also a reasonable distance since the number of billboards increases. However, they are far from the eatery. Advertising beyond a 250m radius is not a good idea.

If you were a Business Analyst for McDonald’s, you could further build your results. How? 
1. Data sets can help you look for which way the traffic faces the billboard. 
2. Is there a convenient way to take a detour to the closest Burger King location for a customized billboard?
3. Check if the billboard is digital and whether you could customize the message by the time of the day or the weather?
4. Are there other billboards in the same location? What are their dimensions and exact position?
